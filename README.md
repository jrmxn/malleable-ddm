# Todo:
# Make it so that you can fit multiple subjects?
# Make it so you can include history terms/single trial modulations
# Make it so that you could pass this into an MCMC sampler?
# ddm_bru not currently used, and needs fixing + converting into a pdf
# maybe implement a chi-square minimisation, but meh.
